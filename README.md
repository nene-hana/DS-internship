## ABOUT


This repository contains the complete work completed as part of the **Teklearn Advanced Data Science Internship Program**.  
The internship is designed to simulate **real-world data analyst responsibilities**, focusing on understanding raw business data, cleaning messy datasets, extracting insights, and communicating findings clearly.


Throughout the internship, a **single real-world dataset** is used end-to-end to demonstrate consistency, analytical thinking, and progressive skill development — similar to how data analysts work in industry environments.

## 📁 Dataset Description


**Dataset:** E-Commerce Sales Analysis  
**Domain:** Online Retail / Sales Analytics  


The dataset represents transactional sales data from an e-commerce platform, containing information such as:


- Product details  
- Category information  
- Pricing and revenue  
- Order and sales timestamps  
- Customer purchasing patterns  


This dataset reflects **typical business data challenges**, including missing values, inconsistent formats, and the need for meaningful aggregation.

## 🎯 Problem Statement


The goal of this project is to analyze e-commerce sales data to answer key **business and operational questions**


By answering these questions, businesses can make **data-driven decisions** related to inventory planning, marketing strategy, and revenue optimization.

##  Why This Domain?


E-commerce analytics is a core application area of data science and is highly relevant across industries.  
This domain was chosen because it:


- Represents **real business decision-making scenarios**
- Requires strong **data cleaning and transformation skills**
- Helps develop **analytical thinking**, not just coding ability
- Is widely used by tech companies, startups, and MNCs


Working with sales data also builds foundational skills applicable to finance, marketing, and product analytics roles.
